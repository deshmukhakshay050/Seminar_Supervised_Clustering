# Seminar_Supervised_Clustering

Generally clustering is considered  as technique belonging to unsupervised classification.My seminar topic was to study supervised clustering and to prove Clustering can be considered as a Supervised Classification Technique
I implemented Supervised Clustering on the data sets such as IRIS,PIMA,LIVER datasets.The algorithm was implemented without any 
builtin function.On IRIS data set i got K-fold cross validation accuracy as 96.66% where as on LIVER dataset I got 73.4% and on pima 
78% accuracy.The images are uploaded how supervised clustering performs on above datasets
